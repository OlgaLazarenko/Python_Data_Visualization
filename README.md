# Data Visualization with Python
## Use different Python libraries( Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly , etc) to visulaize data

## 1) Matplotlib library
### 1.1) Data sources:
The following data sets are used: [1985 Auto Imports Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile)
and also here [1985 Auto Imports Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/)
The dataset consists of the files:
- [imports-85.data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/), actually the data
- [imports-85.names](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/), the description

### 1.2) The goals to be reached:
- [] Read the file containing the data about auto imports
- [] Inspect a technical summary of the DataFrame: the columns( the data types:), null values, missing values
- [] Perform the data cleansing and validation
- [] Create visualizations using the Python library Matplotlib

### 1.3) Visualization:
- [x] Create scatter plots
- [] Create line plots
- [x] Create histograms
- [] Create bar charts
#### 1.4) Answer the following questions:
- [] Top 3 most expensive car models
- [] Top 3 car models with highest mileage (city, highway)
- [] Find out that was the most popular body style of the imported cars (sedan,wagon, etc)
- [] Find out the risk factor of  the top 3 most popular imported cars ( the risk factor =-3, the car is risky; the risk factor=3, the car is safe)
- [] Determine what were the relative average loss (year insurance) for the top 3 popular vehicles at each category (2-doors,4-doors, etc)


## 2) Pandas library:
### 2.1) Data sources:
### 2.2) The goals to be reached:
- [x] Read the data from the csv file into a pandas DataFrame 
- [] Inspect a technical summary of the DataFrame: the columns( the data types:), null values, missing values
- [] Validate data, remove the rows with errors, the duplicate rows 
- [] Transform the data if it is necessary 
### 2.3) Visualization:
### 2.4) Answer the questions:
