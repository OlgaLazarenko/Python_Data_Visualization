# Data Visualization with Python
## Use different Python libraries( Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly , etc) to visulaize data

## 1) Matplotlib library
### 1.1) Data sources:
The following data sets are used: [1985 Auto Imports Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile)
and also here [1985 Auto Imports Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/)
The dataset consists of the files:
- [imports-85.data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/), actually the data
- [imports-85.names](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/), the description

### 1.2) The goals to be reached:
- [x] Read the file containing the data about auto imports
- [x] Inspect a technical summary of the DataFrame: the columns( the data types:), null values, missing values
- [] Perform the data cleansing and validation
- [x] Create visualizations using the Python library Matplotlib

### 1.3) Visualization:
- [x] Create scatter plots: single and subplots
- [] Create line plots
- [x] Create histograms: single and subplots
- [] Create bar charts

### 1.4) Answer the following questions:
- [] Top 3 most expensive car models
- [] Top 3 car models with highest mileage (city, highway)
- [] Find out that was the most popular body style of the imported cars (sedan,wagon, etc)
- [] Find out the risk factor of  the top 3 most popular imported cars ( the risk factor =-3, the car is risky; the risk factor=3, the car is safe)
- [] Determine what were the relative average loss (year insurance) for the top 3 popular vehicles at each category (2-doors,4-doors, etc)


## 2) Pandas library:
### 2.1) Data sources:
The following data sets are used:
[Adult Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) 
and
[Income of Companies by Income Type, Annual](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/income-of-companies-by-income-type-annual?resource_id=3b64eaf4-78d7-4312-8167-1a423b83d0db)

### 2.2) The goals to be reached:
- [x] Read the data from the csv file into a pandas DataFrame 
- [x] Inspect a technical summary of the DataFrame: the columns( the data types:), null values, missing values
- [] Validate data, remove the rows with errors, the duplicate rows 
- [] Transform the data if it is necessary 
### 2.3) Visualization:
- [x] Create scatter plot/s: single and subplots
- [x] Create line chart/s, single/multiple
- [x] Create histogram/s
### 2.4) Answer the questions:
